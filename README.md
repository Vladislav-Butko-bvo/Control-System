The FPGA project intended for Intel FPGA. 

The FPGA project implements the following system of equations (further – the formula):

For implementation was created execution algorithm of the formula:

Corresponding to the algorithm, the formula executes with speed until two operations in clock cycle (further – the cycle). In general, need from the 6 to 9 cycles to compute the formula depending on condition.
